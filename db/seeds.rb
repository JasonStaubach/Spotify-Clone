# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# ApplicationRecord.transaction do 
#     puts "Creating users"
#     User.create!(username: 'Demo', password: 'password', birthday: Date.new(2001,4,5), email: "abc@gmail.com")
# end
